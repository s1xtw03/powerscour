# powersack

This script attempts to search files on SMB shares for strings of text. It takes a list of hosts, a list of credentials to try authenticating with, and a list of strings to search for. All testing was performed on Powershell version 5, though you may have luck on earlier versions.

For a list of options and examples, check out its help page with Get-Help .\PowerSack.ps1 -Full
